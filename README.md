A simple sample for a stupendous service.

Installation
------------
* To get started, you should familiarize yourself with the service itself. A
good place to begin is by reading the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-common#quick-start-guide)
 * for testing locally, copy the credentials (starting with `{ credentials: â€¦ }` to `local-credentials.json`
 * go into the Globalization Pipeline dashboard and click New Project
  * create a project with the Project ID `hello` and upload the [hello.json](hello.json) file here as JSON.
  * Add target languages, edit as desired
 * update `manifest.yml` to note the bound service name
* `npm install`
* Now you can use `npm run start` to test locally (using `local-credentials.json`)
* `cf push` this application should post it to your BlueMix instance.
* For decoding the logs, use `npm install -g pino` then `npm run start | pino` ( see [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) )
